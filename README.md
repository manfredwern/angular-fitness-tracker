This a is tutorial that I was following in an online course platform. 
Here we learned how to use `Angular` in building an application. 

We learned:

- have components interact with one another
- make use of state management solutions such us `NgRx`
- use firebase Authentication to manage users
- and cloud firestore as for storing data
- as well as Angular material for the design
